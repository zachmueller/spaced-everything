# Roadmap

Some starting thoughts for things I hope to build out soon:
- Writing inbox (taking from my [template implementation](https://notes.zach.nz/Note-template---Writing-inbox))
- Maybe implement my [session wrapper template](https://notes.zach.nz/Note-template---Session-wrapper-for-my-spaced-writing-practice) functionality
- Further customization within the SuperMemo-2.0 algorithm
- Implement other spacing algorithms
- Possibly allow full JavaScript customization of any arbitrary spacing algorithm
